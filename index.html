            <h1>What does great design look like for an ecommerce store?</h1><br>
            <p>The best ecommerce websites all have one thing in common: they center the user experience from first visit to post-checkout. 
                There are four main components every ecommerce business should consider when designing a website.</p><br>
                <div>
                    <dl>
                        <dt><h2>Building trust with the customer</h2></dt><br>
                        <dd>When someone visits your ecommerce store or website for the first time, they may not know anything about your brand, the quality of your products, or your commitment to making customers happy. 
                            Deals might earn their consideration, but they’ll need to trust you before they actually go through with a purchase.<br>
                            <a href="">Customer trust </a>is hardest to earn when you don’t have any customers, so you’ll want to incorporate the following trust indicators as you <a href="">build your website.</a><br><br>
                             <strong>Contact information</strong><br>
                             Include an email and, if possible, a phone number and a mailing address on a Contact page and in the footer of your site. This type of information, 
                             along with an About page, helps potential customers feel they’re buying from a real person.<br><br>
                             <strong>A return policy</strong><br>
                             A return policy not only makes it easier for people to send back products that don’t satisfy them, it actually increases sales by lowering shopping 
                             cart abandonment and instilling the customer with a sense of confidence and trust that they can send back an item if they need to, without any transaction fees.<br><br>
                            <img src="images/online image2.webp" width="75%" height="auto"></img><br>
                            <strong>Technical certifications</strong><br>
                            By adding <a href="">Shopify Payments</a> to your ecommerce website, you’ll have access to advanced features and payment services featuring the latest security technology for protecting your customers’ information. 
                            Add graphics or badges to show your security compliance and all the payment methods you accept.<br><br>
                            <strong>Customer reviews and testimonials</strong><br>
                            Many ecommerce solutions have app integrations that let you import content into your site. This includes customer photos, your Instagram feed, and even customer reviews. 
                            These are signals to potential customers that your brand is trustworthy. 
                        </dd><br><br>
                        <dt><h2>Creating a visually compelling experience</h2></dt><br>
                        <dd>Perception is everything when selling your products online. People form their first impression of your ecommerce store in mere milliseconds. With your Shopify store, making that impression count rests largely on high-quality images, 
                            consistent <a href="">branding design</a>, smart use of <a href>psycological design</a>, and a clear visual hierarchy.<br>
                            Let’s dig into some best practices for each of these elements:<br><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li> <b>Photography:</b><a href="">Prduct photography</a> is like an ambassador, sharing the promise of your product online. Shoot product photos on a plain background and in many angles. Lifestyle photos are important to show your product in use and in context within an environment. 
                                    They also reinforce a brand aesthetic.</li><br>
                                <li><b>Color:</b> Color is one of the most powerful tools you can use to spark interest and emotion on your ecommerce site. It can also be used to draw attention to specific sections of your website and lead the customer journey.
                                     Smart use of color can help with accessibility, too.</li><br>
                                <li><b>Fonts:</b> While the words you write on your ecommerce site share information, it’s the typography that communicates the emotion behind that information. It’s a good idea to stick to two fonts and create a hierarchy between them. 
                                    Choose one font as your header or title font and another to be your body font.</li><br>
                                <li><b>Psychological design and visual hierarchy:</b> Using psychological design principles allows you to influence customer decision making and the path of their eye by
                                     strategically placing elements, colors, and text on pages.</li><br>
                            </ul><br>
                            <a href="">Outdoor Voices’ </a> features lifestyle images to communicate its brand aesthetic and an aspirational lifestyle. 
                            It focuses on limited fonts for a clean look and a clear visual hierarchy.<br>
                            <img src="images/online image 4.webp" width="1200px" height="600px"></img> 
                        </dd><br><br>
                        <dt><h2> Focusing on responsive design for mobile and desktop</h2></dt><br>
                        <dd>The average daily time spent on a mobile phone in the US is expected to reach 4 hours and 39 minutes by 2024. Luckily, if you’re building your business with Shopify, your store is already responsive. This means the site is user friendly on different devices and screen sizes, 
                            whether customers view it on a desktop, smartphone, or tablet.<br>
                            When choosing an ecommerce website design based on mobile optimization, it’s best to personally test it to see if you’re happy with the transactional flow. If you’re not, 
                            there’s a good chance your customers won’t be either.<br><br>
                        </dd><br><br>
                        <dt><h2> Designing clear navigation</h2></dt><br>
                            <dd>Your website navigation should help customers find your products quickly and easily.
                             Good navigation also helps improve SEO on your site so you get found in search results.<br>
                             Stick to only a few menu headers in your top-level navigation. Be clear and direct when labeling these headers—this is no time to be clever. 
                             Key headers to include in your top-level navigation could include:<br>
                             <ul>
                                <li>Shop</li>
                                <li>About Us</li>
                                <li>Best Seller</li>
                                <li>Contact Us</li>
                             </ul><br>
                             Additional navigation links can go in your footer—the section at the bottom of your website. Return Policy, Terms of Service, 
                             and Contact Us pages can be linked here.</dd><br>

            <h1>8 best ecommerce website design tips</h1><br>
            <p>While you’ll want to design your online store based on your established brand guidelines, there are a few best practices to consider to improve usability and customer experience. 
                Your ecommerce site is the résumé for your online business. Whether you’re a startup or building your fifth ecommerce store, keep these website design tips in mind:</p><br>
            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li><h3>Keep it Simple</h3></li>
                    <dd>
                        Simple is always key to making more sales in your ecommerce business. The more distractions you put on your ecommerce website (think banner ads, pop-ups, too many colors), the more it takes away from making the sale.
                         A good ecommerce platform will have a number of ecommerce website templates to choose from to help you keep your design streamlined

                    <li><h3>Express Your Brand</h3></li5>
                    <dd>
                        It doesn’t matter if you’re a photographer, beautician, or dropshipper running an online business. People want to buy from established brands they trust and identify with. 
                        Take the time to define your brand and figure out what makes you different from competitors—then apply it to your web design.

                        Images can improve a website’s conversion rate by 40%. But they have to be high-quality. 
                        Invest in good product photos and use images from free stock photo websites to help increase the visual appeal throughout the shopping experience

                        You’ll want to have a professional website. Customers won’t give you their hard-earned money or sensitive information like credit card numbers if it’s anything less

                        When designing your ecommerce site, look for places to show social proof like positive reviews and user-generated content. 
                        The more shoppers see the good experiences other people have had with your products, the more likely they’ll be to buy.

                        Even if you have a beautiful, innovative ecommerce website design, if checkout is a pain, customers may not buy from you. 
                        Make checkout for your ecommerce business simple, straightforward, and fast. Use payment gateways like Shop Pay, Amazon Pay, 
                        PayPal, Stripe, and other accelerated payment options to make it as easy as possible for shoppers to buy.<br>
